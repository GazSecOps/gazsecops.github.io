&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-engineer"&gt;Engineer:&lt;/span&gt; The database connection is failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; Check the credentials in the config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-engineer"&gt;Engineer:&lt;/span&gt; Which config? There are twelve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; The one with the password that expires every 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-engineer"&gt;Engineer:&lt;/span&gt; That expired yesterday. Nobody told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; Did you check the rotation runbook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-engineer"&gt;Engineer:&lt;/span&gt; The runbook is in a wiki that requires the database to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service accounts. API keys. Connection strings. Database passwords scattered across config files, environment variables, Kubernetes secrets, and that one spreadsheet someone maintains &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo;. This is how most organisations handle non-human identity. It&amp;rsquo;s also how most organisations get compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;
Every hardcoded credential is a future incident waiting to happen. The question isn't whether it leaks - it's whether you notice when it does.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workload identity is about giving your services proper identities without the secret sprawl. Not another password to rotate. Not another API key to revoke when it appears in a GitHub commit. An identity that your infrastructure manages, rotates, and revokes automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers what workload identity actually means, how to implement it on major clouds and on-prem, and the practical patterns that make it survivable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Smallstep step-ca: Running Internal PKI Without Losing Your Mind</title><link>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/stepca-running-internal-pki/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/stepca-running-internal-pki/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you read my post on building your own CA and thought &amp;ldquo;fine, but how do I actually issue certs without becoming the Certificate Person&amp;rdquo;, this is the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;step-ca&lt;/code&gt; (Smallstep Certificate Authority) is the bit that makes internal PKI usable: automated issuance, short-lived certs, predictable renewal, and enough policy to stop someone minting a wildcard for your entire estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives you a new thing to break at 3am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="dialogue"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-oncall"&gt;On-call:&lt;/span&gt; Everything that talks TLS is failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-engineer"&gt;Engineer:&lt;/span&gt; But we rotated the certs yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; You rotated them to a CA chain nobody trusts. Also the CA is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-management"&gt;Management:&lt;/span&gt; How can the CA being down break existing connections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t. The expiry storm you scheduled does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;
Internal PKI fails in three ways: you lose the keys, you lose the trust, or you lose control of issuance.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers a practical &lt;code&gt;step-ca&lt;/code&gt; setup on a Linux VM, what to lock down, how to issue and renew certs, and the failure modes I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zero Trust: What It Actually Means When You Have to Implement It</title><link>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/zero-trust-what-it-actually-means/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/zero-trust-what-it-actually-means/</guid><description>&lt;div class="dialogue"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-vendor"&gt;Vendor:&lt;/span&gt; Our zero trust platform provides seamless, frictionless, AI-powered security across your entire estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; What does it actually do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-vendor"&gt;Vendor:&lt;/span&gt; It verifies every request, every time, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; So does a firewall rule and a login page. What does yours do differently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-vendor"&gt;Vendor:&lt;/span&gt; &amp;hellip;it has a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero trust has become the most abused term in security marketing. Every vendor has a zero trust product. Every slide deck has a zero trust slide. Every CISO has a zero trust initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them are buying a product and calling it a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;
Zero trust is not a product. It's the slow, painful process of removing implicit trust from your network, one assumption at a time.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about what zero trust actually looks like when you have to implement it. Not the conference version. The version where you&amp;rsquo;re staring at a network diagram, a list of legacy systems, and a budget that won&amp;rsquo;t cover half of what the vendors quoted you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Incident Response: What Actually Works at 3am</title><link>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/incident-response-what-actually-works/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/incident-response-what-actually-works/</guid><description>&lt;div class="dialogue"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-oncall"&gt;On-call:&lt;/span&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m getting paged. Something about unusual outbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-management"&gt;Management:&lt;/span&gt; Is it a breach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-oncall"&gt;On-call:&lt;/span&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet. I&amp;rsquo;ve been awake for forty seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-management"&gt;Management:&lt;/span&gt; We need to tell the board by 8am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-oncall"&gt;On-call:&lt;/span&gt; I need to tell you what&amp;rsquo;s happening first. Give me an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-management"&gt;Management:&lt;/span&gt; You have thirty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incident response plans look great in documents. Neat flowcharts. Escalation matrices. Communication templates. Everyone has a role. Everyone knows what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then something actually happens and none of it works the way the document said it would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;
The best incident response plan is the one your team has actually practised. The second best is any plan at all. Most teams have neither.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about what incident response looks like in practice. Not the framework version. The version where you&amp;rsquo;re half awake, the logs are incomplete, and someone is asking you to confirm it&amp;rsquo;s not a breach before you&amp;rsquo;ve even found the right terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DNS Security: What Actually Breaks</title><link>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/dns-security-what-actually-breaks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gazsecops.github.io/posts/dns-security-what-actually-breaks/</guid><description>&lt;div class="dialogue"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-oncall"&gt;On-call:&lt;/span&gt; The website is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-management"&gt;Management:&lt;/span&gt; But the servers are fine. CPU is low. No errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; Your DNS records point at last week&amp;rsquo;s IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-management"&gt;Management:&lt;/span&gt; DNS is just a phone book. How can that take us down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="speaker speaker-sysadmin"&gt;Sysadmin:&lt;/span&gt; Because your whole company uses it as the source of truth, whether you admit it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS is the most boring critical system you run. Nobody thinks about it until it fails, and when it fails everyone suddenly becomes very interested in TTLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can patch servers. You can roll back deployments. You can add more replicas. None of that matters if clients can&amp;rsquo;t resolve names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS security isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;do DNSSEC and you&amp;rsquo;re done&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s availability, integrity, and watching the bits that attackers like because you usually leave them alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;
DNS isn't a phone book. It's a control plane.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers how DNS breaks in the real world, how attackers use it, what you can monitor without buying a new platform, and what to do at 3am when name resolution goes sideways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
