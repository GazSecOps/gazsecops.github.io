No installation required. No suspicious binaries to explain. Just a shell that&amp;rsquo;s already there, waiting to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For security operators - red team, blue team, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter - this makes Bash incredibly valuable. You can do reconnaissance, establish persistence, monitor systems, or respond to incidents without touching disk or installing tools. Living off the land, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
